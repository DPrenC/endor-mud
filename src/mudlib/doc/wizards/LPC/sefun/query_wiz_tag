SYNOPSIS
    string query_wiz_tag(object|string player, void|int flags)

DESCRIPTION
    Return a string describing the status of <player>, which may be
    given as an actual object or by its name.
    <flags> may be a combination of several bitflags. Currently
    supported are:
      1 : Return a long string instead of the normal short one.
      2 : Don't count domainlords as normal wizards.
    The result is a string of in short form up to four characters.
    For players, 0 is returned.

EXAMPLE
    Assume that 'Deepthough' is (still) God, 'Dagobert' is Domainlord
    and 'Ryuka' is a learner.

      query_wiz_tag("deepthought") -> "God"
      query_wiz_tag("dagobert")    -> "Wiz"
      query_wiz_tag("dagobert", 2) -> "Lord"
      query_wiz_tag("dagobert", 3) -> "Domainlord"
      query_wiz_tag("ryuka")       -> "Appr"
      query_wiz_tag("ryuka", 1)    -> "Apprentice Wizard"
