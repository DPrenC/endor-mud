<P> You are welcome to use and distribute this code freely as long as I
am credited with it's creation.  This system is still under
development.  Feel free to contact me if you have problems or ideas for
improvements or additions to this package. </P>

<P> The INSTALL file should contain all the information you need to set
up the intermud system on your mud. </P>

<P> I have tried to make this package very flexible and portable by
using a modular format.  The inetd.c itself is the hard core of the
system and you should not generally need to alter it in any way.  It
handles the complexities of the encoding / decoding protocol, reply
handling and time outs etc.  The udp directory contains files which
handle specific incoming requests.  Each filename corresponds to the
name of an intermud request.  The inetd will call a function
udp_request() in the file udp/request.c, with a mapping containing the
decoded data as the argument.  The request.c file should handle the
data (see the supplied files for examples).  The inetd provides the
tools you need to set up your own intermud commands for players, but
none are included.  Look in the examples directory for some sample
implementations of intermud commands.  Read the PROTOCOL file for
information on writing commands. </P>
