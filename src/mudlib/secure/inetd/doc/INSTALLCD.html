<TITLE> Intermud INSTALL.CD </TITLE>

<H1> INSTALL.CD </H1>
<P>
This UDP port handling (Intermud) system was designed for muds using the
Amylaar driver, but this release incorporates changes which allow it to run
alongside the MudOS/CDudp systems on a Cdlib mud.
This document describes how to install it onto your CD mud.
</P>
NOTE: It is probably best to install this package in /d/Standard/obj rather
      than /secure on CD muds for security purposes.
</P> <UL> <P>
<LI> Get hold of an INETD_HOSTS file.  This file is not supplied with
     this distribution, but an up-to-date copy should be available from
     the site where you got this package.
</P> <P>
<LI> Incoming udp packets should be directed to the function
     receive_udp(sender, packet) in inetd.c. This is done by editting
     the file /config/sys/local.h and changing the definition of
     UDP_MANAGER to the pathname of the inetd.c. Define OLD_UDP_MANAGER
     to the old definition.  (probably /d/Standard/obj/udp or
     /d/Standard/std/udp for the newer mudlibs)
</P> <P>
<LI> You need to make sure that the old udp system has access to the
     udp lfuns as well as the new one.  This is done by changing the
     send_udp_message() function in /secure/master.c as follows. 
     Change the if at the start of that function to:
<LISTING>
	if (stringp(udp_manager) &&
	(previous_object() == find_object(udp_manager) ||
	previous_object() == find_object(OLD_UDP_MANAGER))
</LISTING>
</P> <P>
<LI> You will need to make the inetd auto-loading at boot time. You do
     this by adding the pathname of the inetd.c to the file
     /secure/preload.data
</P> <P>
<LI> Edit the config section of udp.h. This file should probably be
     placed in a directory listed in your include path.  The
     definitions of LOCAL_NAME and LOCAL_UDP_PORT are probably best
     made as follows:
<LISTING>
	#define LOCAL_NAME	SECURITY->get_mud_name()
	#define LOCAL_UDP_PORT	SECURITY->do_debug("udp_port")
<LISTING>
</P> <P>
<LI> You may need to modify some of the definitions at the top of the
     inetd.c file for your system, particularly if you are not using an
     Amylaar driver.  Changes for CD are indicated where appropriate
     and these should be used if you are uncertain.
</P> <P>
<LI> Make any changes neccessary to the files supplied (as described
     below).
</P> <P>
<LI> Add your mud to the INETD_HOSTS file.
</P> </UL>
<P>
Your mud will need to be added to the host lists at other muds for the
system to realise its full potential, but it will operate
satisfactorily regardless.
</P> <P>
It is a good idea to test out the intermud system at your own site to
iron out any problems you may encounter. You will need to write your
own intermud commands for players to use, but the command files in the
udp directory should give you some good examples of usage. Some example
commands can be found in the examples directory.
</P> <P>
There is a command soul suitable for CDlib muds in the examples
directory. Initially you should copy it to /cmd/wiz_cmd_inetd.c and
edit  /cmd/wiz_cmd_keeper.c - Add "/cmd/wiz_cmd_inetd" to the soul list
in that file and resave it. After updating, keepers will have full
intermud commands which can be used for testing. When you have it up
and running, you should define WIZ_CMD_INETD in /secure/std.h and add
the soul to any command souls you wish to have access to the commands. 
</P>
<DL> <P>
<DT>udp/who.c	<DD>Handles who requests from remote sites. The DATA field should
		be a string containing the who information.
</P> <P>
<DT>udp/finger.c	<DD>DATA field should be a string containing the finger info.
</P> <P>
<DT>udp/channel.c	<DD>This handles all incoming channel messages. It uses the header
		"CHANNEL" to identify the channel name, "CMD" to identify a
		special command, and DATA for the message body.
                The message is formatted and sent to all wizards on the mud.
		Incoming messages can be blocked by setting earmuffs != 1.
		This basic system relies on a function
		receive_channel_msg(string channel, string msg) being defined
		in all players who will receive the channel messages. It
		should pass on any received messages to player as long as
		'msg' != 0. It should return 1 if the player is listening to
		the specified channel and 0 otherwise.
		You will probably want to alter this module to incorporate it
		into your local channel system or to make it more
		user-friendly.
</P> <P>
<DT>udp/man.c	<DD>Handles remote man requests. The DATA field should be a string
		containing the manual page or information.
</P> <P>
<DT>udp/query.c	<DD>Change the EMAIL #define to yourself (or a relevant email).
</P> <P>
<DT>udp/ftp.c	<DD>Define the FTP_ROOT_DIR as appropriate. You will need to make
		sure this file has privilege to read (and write if PUTFILE is
		defined) to files inside FTP_ROOT_DIR.
</P> </DL>
