<TITLE> Intermud TODO </TITLE>
<H1> TODO (0.7a) </H1>
<P>
This file is a combination of a conventional TODO file and my ideas for
possible future developments of the system.
</P>
<HR>
<UL>
<LI> Auto-update of the HOST_COMMANDS in the host list? : Failed
     commands will be removed from the list and logged.
<LI> System responses etc. (unknown queries) (See also above). This
     really is necessary for a secure intermud mail system.
<LI> Remote list updating?
<LI> Reduce the amount of call_out's used ??? :<BR>
     Timeout incoming_packets and received_ids with hb instead of call_out.
     Only use call_out for externally visible calls, ie. timeouts (to
     prevent problems with eval cost).
     Perhaps use hb in all cases and then call external objects using
     call_out.
<LI> "Fake Mud" checking should be done against definitions in udp.h,
     not date from the host list.
<LI> The ftp protocol/reliability needs to be improved.
<LI> Implement INETD_SAVE_FILE: file that hosts is stored in to allow last
     access data etc. to be retained.
<LI> Should a special mudname "*" be supported by send_udp() to make commands
     such as channel commands more efficient?
<LI> Should send_udp() be overloaded to accept an array of mudnames?
<LI> Implement special "application" hosts ??? :<BR>
     INETD_APPS file containing applications (stored separately from regular
     hosts so they are not queried by query:hosts), which are referred to as
     "app:name" via send_udp(), or maybe a seperate function providing a
     more appropriate protocol ?
<LI> When a new mud is detected, a system packet should be sent to all other
     muds, notifying them?  At the moment a new mud may never be detected at
     some sites which are not listed on the new muds host list.
<LI> Add ierror.h file to allow users to configure their own error messages.
     Or perhaps name it inetd.h and move all the inetd configuration options
     to it.
<LI> New-style packet encoding means the DATA field is effectively obsolete.
     Change udp data-handling functions to use 2 arguments for intermud
     data: (1) the "header" (a mapping as-per normal, excluding the DATA
     field). (2) The "data" or "body" (what would have been in the DATA
     field)
