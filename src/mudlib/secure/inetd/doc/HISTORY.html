<TITLE> Intermud HISTORY </TITLE>
<H1> HISTORY </H1>

<P>
Dissapointed with the lack of a well implemented intermud system for
Amylaar muds, I originally intended to simply port the CD intermud
system.  After examining the code for the CD system I became
disenchanted by it's design and what I saw as limitations in it's
protocol and implementation - in particular it's limitations on the
size of data transferred and it's lack of any form of reliability
scheme.
</P> <P>
Around this time Alvin@Sushi (aka. James Armstrong) began experimenting
with his own UDP-based intermud system which included simple
handshaking.  I was involved in testing of this code and - inspired by
this approach - began developing my own system based on the concepts
conceived by Alvin.
</P> <P>
Since it conception, the intermud package (often referred to as the
"inetd" system) has become a fully fledged and functional intermud
communication system.  More recently, testing and development has been
done on both Amylaar and CD based muds to ensure that the code is fully
portable between the two systems. It also allows the CD intermud system
to run alongside it to provide the greatest flexibility and
compatability to mud admins.
