Intermud ftp is a special mud protocol which allows the transfer files from
one mud to another.

Intermud FTP consists of 3 commands.

    fls <mudname> <dirname>	- will give a list of available files 
				  (usually /ftp)
    fget <mudname> <filename>   - will get the file from the specified	
				  mud, (to /ftp/incoming)
    fput <mudname> <filename>   - will put the file from your mud to the
				  specified mud.
	
NB:  Full paths are required for filename.
	 Intermud ftp is not globally supported.
